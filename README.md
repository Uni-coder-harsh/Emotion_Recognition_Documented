# Emotion Recognition with FER2013 Dataset

## Project Overview

This project focuses on emotion recognition using the FER2013 dataset. The goal is to classify facial expressions into one of seven emotions: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral**. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to achieve this task.

## Dataset

The FER2013 dataset is a collection of grayscale images of faces, each labeled with one of seven emotions: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral**. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with images stored in separate directories for each emotion.

### Downloading the Dataset
